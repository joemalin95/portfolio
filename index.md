                I am an undergraduate student at DePaul University. I will be graduating in Spring 2018 with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. I have also been working part time at a small company called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roompact.com">Roompact</a> since 2016. I am an aspiring software engineer and hope to use my skills to pursue a career as a web developer.
            </p>
            <p> Throughout my college and work experiences, I have acquired a set of technical skills that have equipped me to plan, design, and build software in a efficient and timely manner. I also have strengthed my set of interpersonal skills that allows me to work well on technical and non-technical teams. I am constantly striving to learn more and better myself as a programmer and a designer. I have built this web portfolio to showcase some of my past, current, and future projects, and it is my hope that as I continue to grow, so will this portfolio.
