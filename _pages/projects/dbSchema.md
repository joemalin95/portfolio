                For my senior capstone project at DePaul university, our class was divided up into groups of 8 and we were assigned the task of making a web application that would have a variety of features. I chose to be the back-end planner and developer since most of my team members were more comfortable with the front-end. There was no assigned manager of the group, so part of the challenge was utilizing our team as efficiently and fairly as possible.

               The first step I took was to get our team thinking about how we should structure the data. Next, we decided which tables and fields were needed in our database. I then used an open source tool to create a visual representation of our database. I also connected the tables in a relational way that would make querying and saving the data in our applicatioon much easier. Finally, I exported the design and taught me teammates how to update the diagram if they needed to make any changes. This level of planning allowed us to work independantly while still having a visual understanding of the data we would be working with. Below is the final design of the database scheme we ened up using.
