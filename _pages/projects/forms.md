        <p>One of the largest projects I have completed while working at Roompact was a feature called Forms. This feature allows our users to create completely customizable forms that can be filed, viewed, and analyzed. It took 5 months and a team of 3 to complete this feature. I helped design, plan, and test the feature. I also designed and coded the frontend.
        </p>
        <p>The biggest challenge was making such a complex feature easy to use. I accomplished this by:
        </p>
        <p>
        <div>
        1. Using guided, simple, step-by-step processes
        </div>
        <div>
        2. Obfuscating advanced options from basic use cases 
        </div>
        <div>
        3. Implementing visual functionality such as drag-and-drop
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
        This feature taught me how to work well with a small team since it required lots of communication and planning. We had different employees working on different parts of the project, so it was a challenge to make sure that everything would merge together cleanly. In the end it was very successful. Below are some screenshots of how Forms turned out.

    You can add, delete, and rearrange many different types of fields to your form. Some field types include paragraph, multiple choice, linear scale, and tags. In this screenshot we have added a field that allows users to tag residents of a university dorm.

    While editing a form template, you can preview how it will look when it is filed out by simply clicking out of a field. This allows the user to check their form layout as they are creating it.
