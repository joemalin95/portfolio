            The first feature I created while working at Roompact was called Events. During the planning stages of development, I created this Technical Details document that conveyed to my team what they could expect from this new feature. I color-coded the document to categorize which features were guaranteed and which were "stretch goals". I used concise, simple language and bullet points so this document could be refereced and searched quickly.
