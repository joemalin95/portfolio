            The Labs page is a public facing Roompact page that allows our users to check up on the progress of projects that we are currently working on. I created the frontend and backend using Javascript, jQuery, and PHP. This feature also included a control panel that allows our team to create new projects and update them as we progress through the feature.

            This feature demonstrates the visual design skills that I have acquired while working at Roompact. Each project has a gray box that contains the project name, icon, expected release, and description of the project. It also has a color coded progress bar that fills in when you scroll to view the project. Finally, each project has a collapsible list of updates that gives more insight into the developmental progress of the feature.
