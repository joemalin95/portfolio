                I designed this portfolio website using Jekyll, JavaScript, and CSS. I started off using a template, but quickly found that I would need to rewrite most of the code to make it work for me. I am currently hosting this through an Amazon Web Services EC2 Linux server that I use for my personal tech projects.

                Since Jekyll produces static websites, I had the opportunity to focus solely on styling this website. One styling feature I have implemented is the ability to collapse the header by clicking on the arrow in the top right corner. My website then saves a cookie in your browser that remembers the header state and keeps it closed even after you visit a different page. Even though I did spend most of my time styling, I am still not satisfied with some of the spacing and colors, but plan to continue working on this in the near future.
