        <p>One of the largest projects I have completed while working at Roompact was a feature called Forms. This feature allows our users to create completely customizable forms that can be filed, viewed, and analyzed. It took 5 months and a team of 3 to complete this feature. I helped design, plan, and test the feature. I also designed and coded the frontend.

        <p>The biggest challenge was making such a complex feature easy to use. I accomplished this by:
        </p>
        <p>
        <div>
        1. Using guided, simple, step-by-step processes
        </div>
        <div>
        2. Obfuscating advanced options from basic use cases 
        </div>
        <div>
        3. Implementing visual functionality such as drag-and-drop
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
        This feature taught me how to work well with a small team since it required lots of communication and planning. We had different employees working on different parts of the project, so it was a challenge to make sure that everything would merge together cleanly. In the end it was very successful. Below are some screenshots of how Forms turned out.
